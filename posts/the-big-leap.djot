You can't ever truly know what a place is like without physically going there (touching grass).
Instagram, video tours, articles, local forums, VR walking tours, none of them can compare to actually
experiencing a place first-hand. Unfortunately, most of us lack the funds and availability to test-drive different places
around the world.
\
\
The same logic applies for vacationing somewhere vs. living there. You might have lived somewhere that everyone
wants to visit, but slowly discovered that the day to day falls massively short of the glamorous appeal.
\
\
My friends and I have the goal to move somewhere together for a short but not too short period (1-6 months depending on visa),
and we've been individually selecting places we think might suit everyone in the group. It's a fun exercise, but we
are also being intentional, as we fully intend to attempt this. We are committed to treat the places we go, and cultures we see,
 with the upmost respect. As short term residents, we want would like to cause as little impact as we can.
\
\
We'll do this House Hunters style, so I've selected three places that I think are suitable for the group.
As a control I've selected a completely random large U.S. city to compare to:

\
Charlotte, North Carolina

\
Now let's go over some non-negotiables and priorities.

{class="text-lg font-bold"}
\
Non-Negotiables:

* Max 1k USD housing expense per person
* Safe, especially considering women and minorities
* Possesses the wow factor

{class="text-lg font-bold"}
\
Priorities:

* Access to natural landmarks (ocean, lakes, mountains)
* Solid climate
* Walkability
* Good public transportation
* Not overcrowded
* Distance to major airport
* High Speed Internet
* Diversity

\
Now for the destinations...

{class="text-lg self-center items-center font-bold"}
\
Panama City, Panama

\
Panama stands out to me a truly unique hidden gem. I just kept finding more and more pros it became hard to track
them all. I think Costa Rica justifiably gets a lot of attention from tourists and expats, but unfortunately as a result,
the cost of living there has exploded. Panama is also a well known tourist/expat location, but I think it still sits
in that "underrated" category for now.

\
Pros:

* No currency conversion 1 Balboa = 1 USD (USD is also standard currency)
* Great opportunity to learn Spanish in a smaller more personable country
* Extremely lenient travel visa laws (Can stay 180 days without a tourist visa!!!)
* Great remote work visa and path to citizenship
* World class healthcare
* Great time conversion (US central time)
* Great international airport with cheap Flights
* No double dip taxes
* High quality water supply
* Very stable economy
* Diverse expat community
* Really bad allergy symptoms for uninitiated
* Good cheap public transportation
* High quality medical and dental care
* Amazing weather in dry season (low humidity, between 75-85F)
* Co-working venues with generators and reliable internet

{class="font-bold"}
\
Cons:

* Bad traffic
* Wealth inequality
* Eating out is vastly more expensive than cooking
* Questionable electricity reliability
* Humid season is really really humid...
