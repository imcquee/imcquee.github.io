## Language server improvements

Productivity and developer experience is a first class concern to us, and in a
modern language good editor support is an important part of the puzzle. To help
Gleam has a built-in language server which is developed and maintained by the
core team. The language server is relatively immature compared to the rest of
the language's tooling, and it is one of the main focuses for core development
at the moment.

It has been improved in these ways:

### Compilation batching

The language server is driven by messages sent by your editor each time a file
is opened, code is edited, autocompletions are needed, and so on. When messages
are received the language server runs the compiler (minus the codegen sections)
to get information about the code.

The language server now batches theses messages intelligently, compiling when
required rather than on every message. For example, if your editor rapidly sends
several text edits and then a request for refactorings the language server will
now apply all the edits to its in-memory filesystem overlay before compiling a
single time. If you are using a faster computer you likely will see no
difference, but if you're using a slower computer or in a very large project
you'll no longer experience a delay before getting feedback from the language
server.

### Autocomplete imports

The language server will now autocomplete module names when writing import
statements. Thank you [Ameen Radwan](https://github.com/Acepie) for this improvement!
